Add an enum specifying the destination of an object
	TestedObject - this should not be mocked
	Params
	Result - 

Problem
	This library should run together with the user code
	And the user needs to mark with an Annotation the funtions he wants to generate Unit Tests for

Try mockito

Apply Strategy pattern

I have more objects that need to be created by the test
	the tested object
	the params
	the result
	
Check if an object is a bean or not. It will help later
