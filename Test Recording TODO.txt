INFO ==========================
	There is another test recorder 
		http://testrecorder.amygdalum.net/index.html
		Get from github and try to see what tests are generated
		

DONE ==========================
	OK - Handle also exceptions thrown by act
		assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new SampleService().testException(5));
	OK - if it's @Component or not

	OK - if the class has equals or not

	OK - handle arrays
	
	OK - handle ArrayList<>


TODO ==========================
	ObjectCodeGenerators
		To create an object we must know
			Get fields to set from getters and public fields
				map from name to class. this way we eliminate the problem with null
			Get constructors and their arguments

			Enum specifying the destination of an object?
				Target - this should not be mocked
				MethodArgument - argument of the method call
				ExpectedResult
				Dependency - dependency of the target, arguments or expected result
				Warning: An object can be MethodArgument + Dependency, or ExpectedResult + Argument
		
			!!!! the dependencies (also dependencies of dependencies ...)
				keep all dependencies in the test to avoid creation of 2 ObjectCodeGenerator for the same object
			!!!! different objects can have common dependencies
				we need a dependency sorter
				
			Non-@Component object creation priority
					Known object like primitives and utils first
						https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/top-10-java-classes-from-utility-package-a4bebde7c267
						Enum
						handle HashMap<>
						handle Map<>
					Unknown objects
						Creation priority
							if NoArgs constructor exists and no fields to be set
								Create with NoArgs constructor 
							OK - if Lombok builder exists
								OK - Create with Lombok builder
							if there is a identifiable constructor covering all the fields
								Create with args constructor 
							if there is a NoArg constructor + all setters
								Create with setters 
							if there is a NoArg constructor + public fields
								Create with fields 
							else
								Cannot create => write some comments explaining fields values to be set
					
			@Component dependencies will be mocked
				Intercept calls to all dependent components and create when() calls
			
	Test Code Generation
		Check expected result
			if returnType != void
				if has equals
					assertEquals(expectedResult, result)
				else 
					if getters exist
						test with getters
					if public fields exist
						test with public fields
			OK - if returnType == void
				skip checking the equals and skip collecting the result

		Check side effects on target, arguments, any dependencies
			create assertEquals() for all the new values
     
	
	Move all the test classes within the testrecording package
	
	Write tests for all the code
		check coverage again

LATER ==========================
	if needed object initialisation code could be learned from github	
	
	http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/private-fields-and-methods.html
	
	Handle Generics

	there will be a case when the dependencies are circular

	create non-components with factory
	
	improve StringGenerator if slow
	
	arrays of arrays
